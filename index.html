        <p>
          <b>William Ford Gibson</b> (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and
          essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as <i>cyberpunk</i>. Beginning his
          writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of
          technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a "combination of lowlife and high tech"—and helped
          to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson
          notably coined the term "cyberspace" for "widespread, interconnected digital technology" in his short story
          "Burning Chrome" (1982), and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel <i>Neuromancer</i>
          (1984). These early works of Gibson's have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature in the
          1980s.

        <h2 class="section--title">Sprawl Trilogy</h2>
        <p>The <b>Sprawl trilogy</b> (also known as the <b>Neuromancer</b>, <b>Cyberspace</b>, or <b>Matrix</b> trilogy)
          is William Gibson's first set of novels, composed of Neuromancer (1984), Count Zero (1986), and Mona Lisa
          Overdrive (1988).
        </p>
        <p>The novels are all set in the same fictional future, and are subtly interlinked by shared characters and
          themes (which are not always readily apparent). The Sprawl trilogy shares this setting with Gibson's short
          stories "Johnny Mnemonic", "New Rose Hotel", and "Burning Chrome", and events and characters from the stories
          appear in or are mentioned at points in the trilogy.

        <h2 class="section--title">Bridge Trilogy</h2>
        <p>The <b>Bridge trilogy</b> comprises the novels Virtual Light (1993), Idoru, (1996) and All Tomorrow's Parties
          (1999). A short story, "Skinner's Room", was originally composed for Visionary San Francisco, a 1990 museum
          exhibition exploring the future of San Francisco.</p>

        <p>Following the turn of the century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly
          realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly
          contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.</p>
