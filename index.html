        <p>
          <b>William Ford Gibson</b> (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and
          essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as <i>cyberpunk</i>. Beginning his
          writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of
          technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a "combination of lowlife and high tech"—and helped
          to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson
          notably coined the term "cyberspace" for "widespread, interconnected digital technology" in his short story
          "Burning Chrome" (1982), and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel <i>Neuromancer</i>
          (1984). These early works of Gibson's have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature in the
          1980s.

        <h2 class="section__title">Sprawl Trilogy</h2>
        <p>The <b>Sprawl trilogy</b> (also known as the <b>Neuromancer</b>, <b>Cyberspace</b>, or <b>Matrix</b> trilogy)
          is William Gibson's first set of novels, composed of Neuromancer (1984), Count Zero (1986), and Mona Lisa
          Overdrive (1988).
        </p>
        <p>The novels are all set in the same fictional future, and are subtly interlinked by shared characters and
          themes (which are not always readily apparent). The Sprawl trilogy shares this setting with Gibson's short
          stories "Johnny Mnemonic", "New Rose Hotel", and "Burning Chrome", and events and characters from the stories
          appear in or are mentioned at points in the trilogy.
        </p>
        <!-- Book 1 -->
        <h3>Neuromancer</h3>
        <img srcset="img/neuromancer-180.jpg 180w,
        img/neuromancer-270.jpg 270w,

        <blockquote>Before the Internet was commonplace, William Gibson showed us the Matrix—a world within the world,
          the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace. Henry Dorsett Case was the sharpest data-thief in the
          Matrix, until an ex-employer crippled his nervous system. Now a new employer has recruited him for a
          last-chance run against an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence. With a mirror-eyed girl
          street-samurai riding shotgun, he’s ready for the silicon-quick, bleakly prophetic adventure that upped the
          ante on an entire genre of fiction.</blockquote>
        <!-- Book 2 -->
        <h3>Count Zero</h3>
        <img srcset="img/count-zero-180.jpg 180w,

        <blockquote>A corporate mercenary wakes in a reconstructed body, a beautiful woman by his side. Then Hosaka
          Corporation reactivates him, for a mission more dangerous than the one he’s recovering from: to get a
          defecting chief of R&D—and the biochip he’s perfected—out intact. But this proves to be of supreme interest to
          certain other parties—some of whom aren’t remotely human...</blockquote>

        <h3>Mona Lisa Overdrive</h3>
        <img srcset="img/mona-lisa-overdrive-180.jpg 180w,

        <blockquote>"Enter Gibson's unique world—lyric and mechanical, sensual and violent, sobering and exciting—where
          multinational corporations and high tech outlaws vie for power, traveling into the computer-generated universe
          known as cyberspace. Into this world comes Mona, a young girl with a murky past and an uncertain future whose
          life is on a collision course with internationally famous Sense/Net star Angie Mitchell. Since childhood,
          Angie has been able to tap into cyberspace without a computer. Now, from inside cyberspace, a kidnapping plot
          is masterminded by a phantom entity who has plans for Mona, Angie, and all humanity, plans that cannot be
          controlled . . . or even known. And behind the intrigue lurks the shadowy Yazuka, the powerful Japanese
          underworld, whose leaders ruthlessly manipulate people and events to suit their own purposes . . . or so they
          think."</blockquote>

        <p>The <b>Bridge trilogy</b> comprises the novels Virtual Light (1993), Idoru, (1996) and All Tomorrow's Parties
          (1999). A short story, "Skinner's Room", was originally composed for Visionary San Francisco, a 1990 museum
          exhibition exploring the future of San Francisco.</p>

        <p>Following the turn of the century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly
          realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly
          contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.</p>
