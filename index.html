        <h2 class="section__title">About</h2>
        <p>
          <b>William Ford Gibson</b> (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and
          essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as <i>cyberpunk</i>. Beginning his
          writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of
          technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a "combination of lowlife and high tech"—and helped
          to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson
          notably coined the term "cyberspace" for "widespread, interconnected digital technology" in his short story
          "Burning Chrome" (1982), and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel <i>Neuromancer</i>
          (1984). These early works of Gibson's have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature in the
          1980s.

          <h2 class="section__title">Sprawl Trilogy</h2>
          <p>The <b>Sprawl trilogy</b> (also known as the <b>Neuromancer</b>, <b>Cyberspace</b>, or <b>Matrix</b>
            trilogy)
            is William Gibson's first set of novels, composed of Neuromancer (1984), Count Zero (1986), and Mona Lisa
            Overdrive (1988).
          </p>
          <p>The novels are all set in the same fictional future, and are subtly interlinked by shared characters and
            themes (which are not always readily apparent). The Sprawl trilogy shares this setting with Gibson's short
            stories "Johnny Mnemonic", "New Rose Hotel", and "Burning Chrome", and events and characters from the
            stories
            appear in or are mentioned at points in the trilogy.

                world, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace. Henry Dorsett Case was the sharpest
                data-thief in the Matrix, until an ex-employer crippled his nervous system. Now a new employer has
                recruited him for a last-chance run against an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence. With a
                mirror-eyed girl street-samurai riding shotgun, he’s ready for the silicon-quick, bleakly prophetic
                adventure that upped the ante on an entire genre of fiction."</blockquote>
